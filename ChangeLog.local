	Add a tool to extract C documentation for gmmproc.

	* tools/docextract_to_xml.pl: Add a tool to extract documentation from
	C source files.  The processing of the description of C functions
	seems a little better than the docextract_to_xml.py script which is
	normally used.  Since it is shorter, it might be a little easier to
	make changes to how the extracting of C docs is done for the
	convenience of *mm projects.
