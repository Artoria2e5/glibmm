2004-01-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/glibmm/object.cc: Object::Object() default constructor. 
	Remove the warning because we really need this to implement a custom
	TreeModel. Derive a new GType, as in the 
	Object::Object(ConstructParams) constructor. Like that constructor, 
	the default one also assumes that you have called a suitable 
	ObjectBase constructor, such as ObejctBase(typeid(MyCustomClass)).

2004-01-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/pm/Output.pm: output_wrap_property(): Allow construct-only
	properties to be wrapped, as read-only properties.

2004-01-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/gmmproc.in, pm/WrapParser.pm, DocsParser.pm: Removed the 
	mergecdocs option - because we always want to merge C docs, to avoid
	accidental upload of half-complete docs.

2003-12-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Makefile.am: Add scripts and tests directories to SUBDIRS instead of 
	DIST_SUBDIRS, so that their Makefile.am files are actually used.
	* scripts/macros.m4: renamed GTKMM_CHECK_PERL() to GLIBMM_CHECK_PERL()
	and install it as glibmm_check_perl.m4, so that other *mm projects
	can use it. They need the PERL_PATH for Doxygen.

2003-12-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs/reference: generate beautify_docs.pl from beautify_docs.pl.in,
	so it can have the perl path in it. Install it, so other *mm 
	modules can use it.

2003-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/m4/*.m4: Added fuller Doxygen documentation to all gobj() and 
	wrap() methods. Doxygen should not emit warnings about these now.

2.3.2:

2003-11-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/m4/signal.m4: Add spaces inside signal_proxy template types,
	to avoid << and >> when using templated types.

2003-11-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/pm/WrapParser.pm, Output.pm: Added WRAP_METHOD_DOCS_ONLY()
	macro.
	* docs/internal/using_gmmproc.txt: Explained the new macro.
	
2003-11-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/glibmm/: Added init.[h|cc] with Glib::init() so that the 
	gnomemm init() methods do not need to initialize gtkmm.
	* tools/m4/class_gobject.m4, class_gtkobject.m4: Added 
	_GMMPROC_PROTECTED_GCLASS macro, needed by libgnomecanvasmm. This
	was not previously properly merged from gtkmm2.
	* tools/m4/property.m4: Re-added PropertyProxy reference documentation
	that did not survive a previous merge from gtkmm2.

2003-11-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/glibmm/propertyproxy.h, propertyproxy_base.[h|cc]: Now uses
	ObjectBase instead of Object, because glib can now have properties
	on interfaces. This is needed, for instance, by the GtkFileChooser
	interface wrapper in gtkmm.
	* glib/glibmm/object.h: Moved get/set_property() methods into 
	ObjectBase, for the same reason.
	* tools/pm/WrapParser.pm, Output.pm: Added optional no_default_handler
	parameter to gmmproc _WRAP_SIGNAL() macro, for signals whose 
	default signal handler is not in the klass struct and therefore
	can not be overridden.

2003-10-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs/Makefile_web.am_fragment: Corrected install location,
	so that links from the gtkmm docs work when they are installed.

2003-10-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs: Added images directory, copied from gtkmm, for the reference
	html docs.
	* configure.in: Mention docs/images/Makefile.
	* docs/reference/Doxyfile.in: Genereate glibmm_doxygen_tags instead
	of gtkmm_doxygen_tags.
	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: dist glibmm_doxygen_tags.
	* docs/reference: gtkmm*.html_fragment are now glibmm*.html_fragment.

2.3.1:
	
2003-10-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/pm/Output.pm: output_wrap_create(): Used
	args_types_and_names_with_default_values() intead of 
	args_types_and_names(), so that create() functions .in .h files have 
	the default values as specified in _WRAP_CREATE() in .hg files.
	* tools/pm/WrapParser.pm: on_ignore_signals(): Strip the quotes, to
  make _IGNORE_SIGNAL() really work in .hg files.

2003-10-02  J. Abelardo Gutierrez <jabelardo@cantv.net>

	* examples/threads/dispatcher.cc
	  examples/threads/dispatcher2.cc: fixed to cast out all gktmm code,
	now they only need glimm.
	* configure.in: Added examples/threads because they don't use gtkmm
	anymore.  Now all examples/threads compiles and run just fine.

2.3.0:

2003-09-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* configure.in: Removed examples/threads because we don't build or
	distribute it, because it doesn't build, because it uses gtkmm.

2003-09-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/glibmm/object_base.h: ObjectBase inherits virtually from
	Sigc::Object. See bug #116280.

2003-09-27  Cedric Gustin  <cedric.gustin@swing.be>
 
 	* glib/glibmm/threadpool.cc: Removed
 	_GTKMMPROC_SIGNAL_H_AND_CC(#ifndef G_OS_WIN32) restrictions. These
 	functions are now implemented in the latest (2.2.4) GTK+ on win32.
 	* README.win32 : Updated list of unsupported functions. 
 
2003-08-20  Frank Naumann  <fnaumann@freemint.de>
  
  	* glib/src/thread.hg,
  	  glib/src/unicode.hg: Warning bugfix for VisualStudio .NET 2003;
  	made wrapper functions returning bool from glib functions
  	returning int (C lacks builtin type bool) explicit by adding 
  	an != 0 check. Otherwise VisualStudio .NET warn about implicit
  	int -> bool cast. 

2003-07-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* glib/glibmm/dispatcher.cc: Added #include <algorithm>, needed
 	by MSVC++, as suggested by Frank Naumann in bug #118215.

2003-05-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/gmmproc.in: Corrected location of installed .pm files. They
	are now in a glibmm-2.3 folder instead of a glibmm-2.4 folder.

2003-05-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Applied some of MSVC++ .NET 2003 changes from jburris. For instance,
	use of Gtk:: prefix with manage, because MSVC++ can not guess it. Also
	corrected the out-of-sync protected/private modifiers in the private
	gtype classes and their prototypes.

2003-05-09  Cedric Gustin  <cedric.gustin@swing.be>

        * glib/glibmm/dispatcher.cc: small typo in G_OS_WIN32 condition.
	
2003-05-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* scripts/macros.m4: Made the --enable-debug-refcounting configure
	option set GLIBMM_* instead of GTKMM_*.

2003-05-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* tools/m4/*.m4: Added doxygen comments to gobj() methods.
 	* examples/markup/parser.cc: Commented-out a std::right that gcc 2.93
 	does not like.

2003-04-23  Andrew Makeev
 
	* glib/glibmm/dispatcher.cc: Added some #ifdefed code to implement
 	Glib::Dispatcher on WIN32. See comments with the code.

2003-04-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Install headers in a glibmm-2.3 directory instead of glibmm-2.4,
	to be consistent with gtkmm 2.4.

2003-04-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* arrayhandle.h, listhandle, slisthandle.h:
	Glib::ListHandle, Glib::ListHandle, Glib::SListHandle: Added 
	reference docs explaining that people can use STL containers.
	
2003-04-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Removed examples/idle: It's now updated and in gtkmm/examples/book.

2003-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/pm/GtkDefs.pm: get_unwrapped(): Changed some & to && to 
	avoid warnings and because that is probably what they should be.

	* tools/m4/extra_defs_gen/generate_defs_glib.cc: Removed parameter
	names from main(), because they are not used. Avoid warning.

2003-03-26  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* glib/src/module.hg: Added API documentation.

2003-03-18  Enrico Scholz  <enrico.scholz@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>
	
	* scripts/*.m4, configure.in:
          Added description to several AC_DEFINE statements to make 'autoheader'
          happy
        * Makefile.am:
          Added ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS to make 'autoreconf' work
	
2003-03-18  Cedric Gustin  <cgustin@ibelgique.com>
 
  	* Makefile.am : removed examples from DIST_SUBDIRS

2003-03-18  Enrico Scholz  <enrico.scholz@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>

	* examples/Makefile.am_fragment:  Added DESTDIR-support.
	
2003-03-14  Cedric Gustin  <cgustin@ibelgique.com>

	* Install examples. The are built by default too. Patch adapted for
	glibmm 2.4 by Murray Cumming.

2003-03-04  Cedric Gustin  <cgustin@ibelgique.com>

 	* configure.in : Removed libstdc++ in LDFLAGS on win32. Latest
 	libtool is taking care of it.
	* build_shared/Makefile_build.am_fragment,
	tools/extra_defs_gen/Makefile.am : Added
	--export-all-symbols linker flag on win32 (required by latest
 	libtool to build DLLs).
 	* build_shared/Makefile_gensrc.am_fragment : Modifiy rule that
 	builds wrap_init.cc. wrap_init.cc now contains reference to all
 	objects, event on win32. #ifdefs are included when needed.
	* README.win32 : updated for version 2.2. Added list of missing
 	methods and signals on win32
	* tools/m4/base.m4 : Added _GTKMMPROC_SIGNAL_H_AND_CC macro.
	

2003-03-14  Martin Schulze  <MHL.Schulze@t-online.de>

	* docs/internal/using_gtkmmproc.txt: Correct name of
	[...]signals.defs generation utiliy.

2003-01-30  Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>

	* glib/src/thread.hg Cond: Add documentation

2003-01-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/glibmm/refptr.h: Removed RefPtr<>::is_null() to encourage use
	of more pointer-like operator bool() instead. Wanted to remove clear()
	too, but there is no =0 equivalent yet.
	* tools/gmmproc.in: Change harcoded gtkmm-2.0/m4 path to glibmm-2.4/m4.

2003-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* GTKMM_ m4 tests and #defines are now prefixed with GLIBMM_

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am_fragment, examples/Makefile.am_fragment: 
	Corrected LIBS and CFLAGS. Not all of these build because they
	use gtkmm stuff too. They need to be reduced to glibmm-only code.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/Makefile.am, glib/glibmm/Makefile.am: Install headers in
	glibmm-2.4 directory rather than gtkmm-2.4

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* configure.in: Use GLIBMM_* instead of GTKMM_* to avoid config.h 
	clashes with gtkmm 2.4.
	* glib/glibmm-2.4.pc.in: Correct cflags - report 2.4 instead of 2.0.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/extra_defs_gen/Makefile.am: Changed extra_defs library name
	from 2.4 to 2.3, so it can be unstable.

2003-01-09  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* glib/glibmm/utility.h (GLIBMM_INITIALIZE_STRUCT): Replace
	__builtin_bzero() with __builtin_memset() because the former is
	deprecated.  Also, it looks like GCC is able to optimize the 0 case
	so we don't lose anything here.

2003-01-09  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* glib/glibmm/miscutils.cc (Glib::build_path): Reserve 256 bytes
	in advance to improve performance.

2003-01-09  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* glib/glibmm/miscutils.{cc,h} (Glib::build_path): Fix to make it
	behave exactly like g_build_path().  (#102885, Jarek Dukat)

	(Glib::build_filename(const std::string&, const std::string&)):
	Implement in terms of Glib::build_path().
	
2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Renamed gtkmmproc to gmmproc.

2003-01-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/glibmm/refptr.h: Removed the operator=(CppObject*), as
	suggested in the TODO comment.

2003-01-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* make distcheck works.

2003-01-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* It now builds, though I haven' tried installing it. The
	library names and header directories should now all have 2.4
	instead of 2.0 in their name.

glibmm was previously part of gtkmm2.
