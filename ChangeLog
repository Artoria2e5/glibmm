	* tests/Makefile.am_fragment, examples/Makefile.am_fragment: 
	Corrected LIBS and CFLAGS. Not all of these build because they
	use gtkmm stuff too. They need to be reduced to glibmm-only code.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/Makefile.am, glib/glibmm/Makefile.am: Install headers in
	glibmm-2.4 directory rather than gtkmm-2.4

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* configure.in: Use GLIBMM_* instead of GTKMM_* to avoid config.h 
	clashes with gtkmm 2.4.
	* glib/glibmm-2.4.pc.in: Correct cflags - report 2.4 instead of 2.0.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/extra_defs_gen/Makefile.am: Changed extra_defs library name
	from 2.4 to 2.3, so it can be unstable.

2003-01-09  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* glib/glibmm/utility.h (GLIBMM_INITIALIZE_STRUCT): Replace
	__builtin_bzero() with __builtin_memset() because the former is
	deprecated.  Also, it looks like GCC is able to optimize the 0 case
	so we don't lose anything here.

2003-01-09  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* glib/glibmm/miscutils.cc (Glib::build_path): Reserve 256 bytes
	in advance to improve performance.

2003-01-09  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* glib/glibmm/miscutils.{cc,h} (Glib::build_path): Fix to make it
	behave exactly like g_build_path().  (#102885, Jarek Dukat)

	(Glib::build_filename(const std::string&, const std::string&)):
	Implement in terms of Glib::build_path().

	* Renamed gtkmmproc to gmmproc.

2003-01-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glib/glibmm/refptr.h: Removed the operator=(CppObject*), as
	suggested in the TODO comment.

2003-01-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* make distcheck works.

2003-01-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* It now builds, though I haven' tried installing it. The
	library names and header directories should now all have 2.4
	instead of 2.0 in their name.

glibmm was previously part of gtkmm2.
